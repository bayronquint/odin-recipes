    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is one of the greatest plates that colombia have, as a child i grew up eating this and i've been eating it since that. <br>
    If i had to choose a unique plate to eat every day on each moment it would be this one. <br> <br>
    It contains rice, chicken, some spices like tomato or coriander and its flavored by salsa or some color which gives that tasty yellow looklike on the rice.
